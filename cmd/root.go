Initialize a project folder with 'dotcli init'.
Add files and folders you want to synchronize from your local system with 'dotcli add'.
Synchronize your files/folders from your system into your dotcli project folder with 'dotcli sync'.
This also works in the reverse way with the command 'dotcli restore'. This can be helpful if you reinstalled your system or want to sync multiple devices to the same dotfiles.`,
