# dotcli

## Usage

Initialize a new dotcli project

```dotcli init```

This can either be done in a new folder or in an already existing folder. A .gitignore file will be created or the .dotfilescli file will be added to it if it already exists.
To prevent this you can add the flag `--ignore-gitignore` to the init command.


Add files and folders to your dotcli project

```dotcli add [files/folders]```


Sync your files and folders to your project

```dotcli sync```

This command syncs all the files and folders you have previously added from your system to your project directory.
